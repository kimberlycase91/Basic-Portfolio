            <section id="about-me">
            <p>I am from Northern Arizona, specifically Show Low. I went to the University of Arizona, where I studied Elementary Education.
            </p>
            <p>After graduationg, I stayed in Tucson, where I taught for the last six years. I recently moved to the valley, where I teach 4th grade Math and Science, but I am looking forward to a career change.
            </p>
            <p>I have a five year old son named Brighton, and I also live with my autistic brother. They are my motivation, because I want to be able to give them a great life. We enjoy going for bike rides and nature walks. We also enjoy going to the park and swimming when we can, which won't be for awhile now!!
